I have just finished setting up my first GitHub page, how exciting!. Firstly, I want to introduce myself briefly. I am Tolga Göğebakan 28 years old man who lives in İzmir, Turkey. I have majored both Biology and Economics at the same time. I graduated with honour degree both of them. After one year of advance English education I started my integrated PhD in Economics at Anadolu University. I continue my PhD education at Ege University, İzmir.

The idea behind open source projects has changed my lifeline inevitably. While I was working for an international company as Finance Assistant the first thing that make me meet with open source projects was deficiencies of Microsoft Excel. Yes I accept it is a really powerful tool to evaluate data and simplify the data analytics process. However if we start thinking about customisable big data analytics projects like take the data from the sources with thess criteria, tidy it, analyse and/or visualize it with the most powerful methods on market and tell me "Why should I convince myself to believe the statement of ..." even powerful Excel by Microsoft become insufficient. But don't forget that it doesn't mean I recommend not to use excel like tools (eviews, stata, spss and others) to analyse small scale data.

With the help of Google, I easily reached the most powerful data analytics tools, R and Python both of them are open source projects. At this time I did know what open source is but that is it, only knew the definition! While I was digging deeper about R and Python I faced great communities behind them. How the communities support newbies literally shocked me. They are serving to younger mind as a mentor for free. How come in the world of Capitalism something is for free. Don't forget I was a finance guy at this time so I couldn't manage to understand the idea in the first place. I start viewing with a jaundiced eye to the matter but just nothing I got bad about it. The idea behind open source projects as pure as the driven snow these people forming communities as generous as the rain. 

After some time I looked at the mirror and saw changing the colour of my eyes they start becoming green, the green of open source. I decided to move and live in this semi-virtual world until the end of my life. It is the world of opportunity! If you search and study hard you could be the one who serves as a mentor to younger people.

I believe I am now qualified enough to start a local open source project. The website of the project is (https://www.verianaliz.net/). It will hopefully be the centre of Turkish data scientists and analysts and all people who need data science consulting. All content will be in Turkish but please follow updates. I will launch a similar project in English as soon as possible. The idea behind the project is everybody can reach analysis with latest data science tools. As the most advanced tools are open source the product of these tools, data products, could be free of charge. I also created a section to inform newbies about data science tools in Turkish. 

Thanks for reading. See you soon!
